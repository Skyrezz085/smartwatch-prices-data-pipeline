## **Methodology üîß**

1. **Initial Load to PostgreSQL**: Data is stored in a relational database for structured querying.
2. **ETL via Apache Airflow**: DAGs manage data cleaning, formatting, and transformation processes.
3. **Validation and Quality Checks**: Cleaning includes standardizing price and numerical values.
4. **Indexing in Elasticsearch**: Enables full-text search and fast aggregations.
5. **Kibana Visualization**: Dashboards display pricing distributions, feature trends, and brand insights.

## **Conclusion üìä**

- **Pricing Trends**: Brands like Apple and Garmin dominate premium pricing, while Amazfit and Xiaomi cater to budget segments.
- **Feature Influence**: Watches with GPS and NFC tend to have higher prices.
- **Battery Life**: Longer battery life is more common in fitness-focused devices.
- **Display Insights**: AMOLED displays are frequent among mid to high-end models.
- **Water Resistance**: Most models offer some level of water protection, typically 30‚Äì50 meters.

## **Recommendations üí°**

1. **Product Positioning**: Emphasize high-value specs (GPS, AMOLED, water resistance) for mid-range segments.
2. **Brand Benchmarking**: Use market data to align product pricing with competitors.
3. **Battery Optimization**: Increase battery life for value-smartwatches to compete better.
